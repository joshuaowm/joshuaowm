# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Owen, a marine biologist from Bekasi, Indonesia, who's trying to learn programming through the internet.

My interest in GIS has brought me to learn computer science and languages such as Python and SQL (I think it's cool to know programming languages).

I'm currently learning computer science from [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science).

Can't wait to use this platform for more projects and learning new stuff.
