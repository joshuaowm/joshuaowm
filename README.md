# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Owen, a marine biologist from Bekasi, Indonesia, who's trying to learn programming through the internet.

My interest in GIS has brought me to learn computer science and languages such as Python and SQL and also I think it's cool to know programming languages.

I am currently seeking opportunities to build my professional career while deepening my skills in programming, data analysis, and spatial science.

Can't wait to use this platform for more projects and learning new stuff.
